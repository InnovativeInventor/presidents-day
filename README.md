## President's Day

President's day is an annual tradition at Choate where the Head of School cancels the next day of school without prior notice. This project attempts to gather historical data of president's day in order to predict future president's day. 

Currently, all data has been gathered from reading physical copies of The Choate News from the School Archive. The dataset is released into the public domain for future use by Choate students (`/historical-days.csv`).

## Analysis
See `/analysis.ipynb`

## Fun fact
The start date of this project was coincidentally 2020's president's day.
